I would like to tell you some interesting facts about javascript:
1.Its everywhere.
2.Its flexible.
3.Its easy to learn. 
4.Its community
5.Its in demand. 
If you want to be a programmer, you need to learn JavaScript. Because it’s so widely used,
you will be hard-pressed to find a job listing for a developer that does not require it.
It’s the de facto language of the web, other than HTML/CSS of course.
